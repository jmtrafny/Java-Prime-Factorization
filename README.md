# Java-Prime-Factorization
My best friend's hobby is a strange one, he enjoys factoring large prime numbers by hand. He can spend hours to days doing the math, oftentimes over at my house. We had a contest on one of these occasions to see what would be faster: me writing a program to factor prime numbers for me, or him working it out by hand. No calculators and no google (although, he graciously allowed me to use the Java Docs!)

It was a fun little contest (that he won, I'll admit it... he's very fast), but instead of stashing the program in my "Fun Stuff" folder I decided I would post it up here. Prime factorization is a trivial task for a computer, but it can quickly become a complex. While the complexity for factorization is only O(n), we tend to use obscenely large numbers in these types of problems. Because of these large numbers, we get a phenomenon called pseudopolynomiality: a complexity that seems to be polynomial, but really isn't.
